<!-- Abstract

Viral pathogens are an enduring threat to global public health.
Here, I present on our efforts to characterize the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of RNA viruses with emphasis on influenza, Ebola and Zika viruses.
Owing to rapid mutation, the evolution of such viruses occurs on a human timescale.
Charting their evolution through phylogenetics can reveal otherwise opaque patterns of epidemic growth and viral spread.
We've built phylogenetic models to characterize spread of influenza antigenic variants and geographic spread of Ebola and Zika.
We are now working to deploy these inferences in a "real-time" fashion and inform outbreak response by public health entities.
